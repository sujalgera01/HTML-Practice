	<h1>Coding Challenge 3</h1>
	<p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restraunts. The bills were rs 1240, rs 480 and rs 2680</p>
	<p>
		To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a fn). He likes to tip 20% when the bill is less than 500 Rs, 15% when the bill is between Rs 500 and 1500, and 10% if the bill is more than Rs 1500.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, john would like to create two arrays:
		a) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)<br>
		b) Containg all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
	</p>
	<p>open up the console.</p>
