	<p style="margin: 20px;">When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the <b><em>unimaginable</em></b>: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati... the most <b><em>powerful</em></b> underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has surfaced from the shadows to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most <b><em>hated</em></b> enemy... the Catholic Church. <br>Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces he has hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a <b><em>beautiful</em></b> and <b><em>mysterious</em></b> Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival.
